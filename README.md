"# Bitwise-TileMapper" 

Tile Mapper is a versatile and intuitive program that assists in the creation of tilesets and
transitions utilizing the bitwise tile mapping method. It can be used by independent developers
making 2D games that would utilize such tilesets, and it is especially useful to those
participating in game jams where both time and budget are extremely limited. This application
allows the user to create or import all images needed for a full tileset and compile them in a
format that can be easily imported into a game utilizing the bitwise tile mapping method.
